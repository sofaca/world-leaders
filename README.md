# world-leaders
This is a self assigned proyect to be done with the purpose of learning about handling datasets on python...

Hopefully the end result will be something like a code where once can enter a specific region and observe the group of leadrs at thhat time, how they got to power, how the left it, etc
To somewhat have a baseline on which to read the political direction taken at that certain point in history...
